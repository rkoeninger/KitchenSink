# zed-sharp

A library for robust programming in C#/.Net

### Maybe, Validation, Lens

Fundamental types for handling missing data (instead of using null), potentially invalid data and updating persistent data structures.

### Match

Value matching construct that can be extended with additional types and extension methods.

### Table

A relational data structure that supports Select and Where operations and composable Projections and Conditions.

### Natural, Tuple extensions

Use of Tuples as static-length heterogenious lists. A series of singleton classes to model natural numbers for compile-time checking and abstraction of Tuple element access.

### Zisp

An external DSL for writing Expression Trees based on Lisp syntax. Makes writing configuration code much easier.

## Techniques

Built using:
* T4 templates
* Use of classes to model typestates
* Type inference for Zisp
